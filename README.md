# From Data to Diagnostics: Master Internship

<p>
  This repository includes the code for the graduation internship at ASML. 
  
  Period September 2024 - February 2025.

## Problem Description
<p>
  ASML is a high-tech semiconductor company that manufactures complex lithography machines. Thousands of ASML lithography machines are operating 24/7 throughout the world at chip factories, to produce integrated circuits (IC). Due to the extreme accuracy of these machines, problems or failures in their operations occur regularly and eventually this would cause downtime. Fast diagnosis of failures is a critical step in maintenance of an ASML equipment, as downtime in high-end chip factories is extremely costly and it can cost $20 per second of unscheduled downtime. When a machine has a failure, a service engineer must be able to identify the source of the problem. That is why this is crucial to help steer engineers in the correct direction. However, this sometimes can be a time consuming and knowledge intensive task. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to research and discover a methodology that addresses those issues and helps engineers discover the issue in a more efficient manner.

## The solution
The intern - [Deyna Baeva](https://github.com/deynabaevax) worked on two-case experimental research project which discovered a potential way of implementing Bayesian Networks to address the problem description.
